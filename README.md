# EasyPytheasy
A repository where I upload the scripts I create to improve my life, learning Python and stop using strange webs where your data can be doxed. Stay tuned!! :D

# YouTube Downloader
This script allows you to download vídeos and audios from YouTube in various formats (mp4, webm...) and various resolutions. In the future this program will allow you to select which resolution and audio quality do you want and merge it in a unique file, bypassing the restriction of the DASH (Dynamic Adaptative Streaming over HTTP). 

# Instagram Downloader
This script allows you to dowload photos and vídeos (including stories) from public Instagram profiles. May be in the future a login interface will be included using the Instagram API grant access to private content.
